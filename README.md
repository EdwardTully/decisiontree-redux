Here I am putting together a algorithm/decision tree with redux to make the state more accessable.  This also makes it easier to pass state info throughout the application, and store to responses to the tree to a central store. This is an enhancement to the first attempt where we use router.  At this point after initial commit, I need to make a back button with useNavigate, and make a sumbit button in the Window to advance the form entries.
